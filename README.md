## Introduction

Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a secure communication method that uses quantum mechanics principles to encrypt and decrypt data. Continuous Variable Quantum Key Distribution (CV-QKD) is a variant of QKD that utilizes continuous variables, such as the quadratures of the electromagnetic field, for encoding information.

This repository contains code for detecting various types of attacks on CV-QKD systems by analyzing the characteristics of the transmitted signals and applying machine learning models.

## Features

- **Attack Detection**: Detect various types of attacks on CV-QKD systems.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilize different machine learning models for attack detection.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze the characteristics of CV-QKD signals.
- **Visualization**: Visualize data and model performance.
